# Samurai of the Vines 

**Samurai of the Vines** is a fast-paced first-person endless runner that puts you in the sandals of a lone jungle samurai. With nothing but your blade and reflexes, you must dodge deadly traps, leap across twisting vines, and slash through obstacles as you charge deeper into the wild.

## Development Journey
This is my **first game**, and I have been working on it for about two months. While the project is still a work-in-progress, it represents a huge milestone for me.

* **Timeline:** 2 Months
* **Art:** 100% custom 3D assets created by me.
* **Goal:** To blend the mechanics of an endless runner with the precision of a samurai action game.

## Known Issues:
* **Audio:** Music stops playing when clicking the "Restart" button after dying.
* **UI:** The "Quit" and "Settings" buttons are currently non-functional.
* **Scoring:** An occasional bug causes the score to increase infinitely at a rapid rate, even after the player dies.
